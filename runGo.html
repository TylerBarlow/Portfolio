                <h4>Summary</h4>
                <p>Ghost run is a feature mockup for the running companion app RunGo. The feature was based on the idea that people enjoy compition when running, but it’s not always easy to organize a race. Using ghost run, the user can race against a friend, or themselves, by running against a virtual “ghost” of that person.</p>

                <h3>Project Prompt</h3>
                <p>The project goal was to design and mockup a feature for an existing app. The app chosen is RunGo, a running compainion app. RunGo helps users find new running routes in their city, as well as helps track their running performance. The project started with an audit of the app, and concluded with creating a new feature, taking it from ideation to mockup.</p>

                <h3>Exploratory Research</h3>
                <p>We started by breaking down the features and flows of the app, and conducting a small user study to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the current app. It was found that the primary pain points with the app were: finding high quality routes, knowing if routes were safe, and finding the motivation to use the app. </p>

                <h3>Personas</h3>
                <p>Based on our research we created two personas of potential users. These users were made to show two seperate sides of people who run, the beginner and the advanced runner. We wanted our feature to appeal to both of these user groups.</p>

                <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
                <p>The goal we decided to focus on for our proposed app feature, was increasing motivation to get out and run. Our idea was to offer a way easily start a competition with yourself or a friend. To accomplish this, we designed a system of playing back previously recorded runs while starting a new run, creating a virtual race.</p>

                <h3>Wireframes</h3>
                <p>Wireframes were developed to plan out how the feature would work. The main components were 3 lists: my runs, friends, and leaderboard, and the integration into the existing run underway screen.</p>

                <p>It was important that the style of the new feature matched the existing style of the app. Being new to UI design, having the set styles to build off of helped in learning patterns and designing interaction.</p>

                <p>When the run is over, the users pace is recorded and placed into a list with their other runs. It was important to encourage the user no matter what their result was. Even if the recent run was the users worst time, we encourage them by saying “Not every day can be your best. Keep at it!”</p>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <p>This app feature design was my first attempt at designing UI/UX from start to finish. The small amount of usertesting done made me understand the importance and benifit of talking to real users. Working with an existing style and framework helped learn how content and actions are organized in a fully functioning product. My role doing mockup design was a learning experience in how to effectively build an app feature.</p>
